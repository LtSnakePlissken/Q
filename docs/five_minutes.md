# Q onboarding in 5 minutes

## Install MetaMask

First install the browser add-on 'MetaMask'. After successful installation, add a custom network and enter the Q network configuration details that are documented within [MetaMask tutorial](how_to_install_metamask.md). Finally, create two new accounts so you can later send Q tokens from one to another.

## Get your first Q

Q tokens will be made available shortly for public sale.

## Verify Q funding

Once you have funded your wallet account, open MetaMask and select the according wallet account. It should now have received a couple of Q's and should display an according balance.

## Send Q

Within MetaMask, click on "send", then "transfer between my accounts" and select the second wallet account you just created. Finish the transaction and wait for the entered amount of Q to be transferred from account to account. You can verify the transaction within the Q block explorer located at `https://explorer.q.org`. You can of course send Q to any other wallet address you know.

## Earn rewards

Now open a new tab and head over to `https://hq.q.org`. If you have MetaMask still activated and connected to Q mainnet, you should be browsing the Q decentralised app that allows users to [excercise governance rights](how_to_exercise_governance_rights.md), [earn rewards on Q tokens](how_to_earn_extra_Q_tokens.md) or do some [saving and borrowing with Q DeFi](how_to_obtain_a_loan_against_a_collateral.md).
